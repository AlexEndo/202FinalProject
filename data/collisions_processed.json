The Volvo pulled out of its parking space, made a U-turn into the opposite travel lane, then crossed the double-yellow centerline and veered into the Zoox vehicle's lane. The Zoox vehicle braked for the encroaching car, but the Volvo still struck the driver's-side fender and both doors. The Zoox operator then disengaged autonomy and brought the vehicle to a stop. The Zoox vehicle sustained major side damage and was towed; the Volvo's frontal airbags deployed and it had moderate front driver's-side damage. The Volvo driver fled without exchanging information, police responded, and no injuries were reported.",

At that time, a passenger car (Vehicle 2), traveling directly behind the Zoox vehicle, struck the left rear corner of the Zoox vehicle. The driver of Vehicle 2 did not stop and continued along 9th Street after the incident. The Zoox vehicle incurred moderate damage, and the police were not notified.

The Zoox vehicle braked to a stop as the e-scooterist was beginning to enter the intersection. The e-scooterist then made contact with the right rear side of the stopped Zoox vehicle, and the e-scooterist fell to the ground next to the Zoox vehicle. The Zoox vehicle then started to move and completed the right turn onto Treat Avenue, coming to a stop a short distance down Treat Avenue. The e-scooterist then walked themself and the e-scooter over to the sidewalk, where they were met by a member of the Zoox operations team, and they reported a chipped tooth and jaw pain. The e-scooterist declined medical attention and rode their e-scooter from the scene after exchanging information. There was no damage to the Zoox vehicle and the police were not called.",

A bicyclist, riding northwest on the sidewalk along 10th Street, then approached the crosswalk. As the bicyclist entered the crosswalk, the operator of the Zoox vehicle disengaged from autonomy and began to manually drive the vehicle forward. The bicyclist veered right towards the front of the Zoox vehicle and made contact with the front passenger side door of the Zoox vehicle. The bicycle then fell to the ground next to the Zoox vehicle. After stopping for a brief conversation with the bicyclist, the Zoox vehicle operator proceeded to make the right turn onto 10th Street, inadvertently driving over the front wheel of the fallen bicycle. The operator completed the turn and pulled over to check for damages and exchange information. The Zoox vehicle did not sustain any damage; however, the front wheel rim of the bicycle was damaged.

The Zoox vehicle slowed and moved to the right for the oncoming Vehicle 2; however, as Vehicle 2 passed, its driver's side mirror made contact with the driver's side rear of the Zoox vehicle. The driver of Vehicle 2 failed to stop and exchange information. The Zoox vehicle did not sustain any damage, but Vehicle 2 appeared to have sustained minor damage to its driver's side mirror. There were no reported injuries, and the police were not notified.",
