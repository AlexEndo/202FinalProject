The Zoox vehicle sustained minor rear-end damage, the Honda Fit had moderate front-left and hood damage, both the Zoox driver and front-seat software operator reported injuries, and police were not called.",

At that time, a passenger car (Vehicle 2), traveling directly behind the Zoox vehicle, struck the left rear corner of the Zoox vehicle. The driver of Vehicle 2 did not stop and continued along 9th Street after the incident. The Zoox vehicle incurred moderate damage, and the police were not notified.

At that time, an approaching e-scooterist was also traveling south on Bryant Street in the curb lane offset from the Zoox vehicle. The Zoox vehicle braked to a stop as the e-scooterist was beginning to enter the intersection. The e-scooterist then made contact with the right rear side of the stopped Zoox vehicle, and the e-scooterist fell to the ground next to the Zoox vehicle. The Zoox vehicle then started to move and completed the right turn onto Treat Avenue, coming to a stop a short distance down Treat Avenue. The e-scooterist then walked themself and the e-scooter over to the sidewalk, where they were met by a member of the Zoox operations team, and they reported a chipped tooth and jaw pain. The e-scooterist declined medical attention and rode their e-scooter from the scene after exchanging information. There was no damage to the Zoox vehicle and the police were not called.",

A bicyclist, riding northwest on the sidewalk along 10th Street, then approached the crosswalk. As the bicyclist entered the crosswalk, the operator of the Zoox vehicle disengaged from autonomy and began to manually drive the vehicle forward. The bicyclist veered right towards the front of the Zoox vehicle and made contact with the front passenger side door of the Zoox vehicle. The bicycle then fell to the ground next to the Zoox vehicle. After stopping for a brief conversation with the bicyclist, the Zoox vehicle operator proceeded to make the right turn onto 10th Street, inadvertently driving over the front wheel of the fallen bicycle. The operator completed the turn and pulled over to check for damages and exchange information. The Zoox vehicle did not sustain any damage; however, the front wheel rim of the bicycle was damaged.
