                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        Autonomous vehicles represent one of the most transformative technologies of our time, promising
                        to revolutionize transportation, reduce accidents caused by human error, and improve mobility
                        for millions. However, as with any emerging technology, the path to widespread adoption requires
                        rigorous testing, transparent reporting, and public scrutiny. California has positioned itself
                        as a global leader in autonomous vehicle development, with numerous companies testing
                        self-driving cars on public roads throughout the state. With this innovation comes
                        responsibility—manufacturers are required to report every collision involving their autonomous
                        vehicles to ensure accountability and track safety performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>AV Collision Tracker</strong> was created to make this critical safety data
                        accessible and understandable to the public. While collision reports are publicly available
                        through the California Department of Motor Vehicles, they exist primarily as individual PDF
                        documents that are difficult to analyze collectively. This application transforms that raw data
                        into an interactive, visual experience that enables researchers, policymakers, journalists, and
                        concerned citizens to explore patterns, identify trends, and gain insights into autonomous
                        vehicle safety across the state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through an interactive map interface, users can see exactly where collisions have occurred,
                        examine details about each incident, and filter by multiple criteria including manufacturer,
                        collision type, vehicle control state, and severity. The analytics dashboard provides temporal
                        trends and comparative statistics that reveal how different manufacturers perform over time. By
                        democratizing access to this information, this project aims to foster informed public discourse
                        about autonomous vehicle safety and support evidence-based decision-making as this technology
                        continues to evolve.
