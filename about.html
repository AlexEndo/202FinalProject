                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        This application is designed to visualize and analyze collision reports involving autonomous
                        vehicles (AVs) in California.
                        As autonomous vehicle technology advances and pilot programs expand, transparency and public
                        awareness of safety incidents are crucial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>AV Collision Tracker</strong> provides an interactive map to explore where incidents
                        occur, filters to slice the data by manufacturer or severity,
                        and an analytics dashboard to understand broader trends.
